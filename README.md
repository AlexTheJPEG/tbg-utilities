# TBG-Utilities
Some utilities for the Text Based Games Forums (http://tbgforums.com/forums)

They are mostly for updating leaderboards, maybe posting content every now and then, etc. If you would like to contribute by making a utility of your own, feel free to do so. Any language is acceptable, but Python is preferred. You can also choose to fix bugs or make utilities more efficient.

## Rainbows (script: `rainbows/rainbows.py`)
Display all the rainbows from the Rainbows topic (https://tbgforums.com/forums/viewtopic.php?id=2956).

The rainbows list is automatically scraped from the topic using Scrapy. When the script is run for the first time, it will get posts from the topic and update the rainbows. The rainbow data is stored in `rainbows.json`. For now, to manually update the list, simply delete the `rainbows.json` file.
