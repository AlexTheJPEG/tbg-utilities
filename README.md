# TBG-Utilities
Some utilities for the Text Based Games Forums (http://tbgforums.com/forums)

They are mostly for updating leaderboards, maybe posting content every now and then, etc.
If you would like to contribute by making a utility of your own, feel free to do so. Any language is acceptable, but Python is preferred. You can also choose to fix bugs or make utilities more efficient.
